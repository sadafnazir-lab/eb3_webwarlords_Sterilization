Experiment 1: Preparation and sterilization of media and glassware for microbial counts

**1.Story Outline:**

Sterilization is a process of killing vegetative and spore of microorganisms. The aim of the process is to create aseptic conditions for carrying out various culture techniques. It involves a high temperature treatment of greater than 100 °C. Sterilization is carried out in an autoclave at 121°C, 15 psi for 20 minutes. All the glassware and media required for preparing pure microbial cultures are sterilized to avoid contamination of microbial colonies.

**2.Story:**

The glasswares required for preparing a pure culture are selected. Glass wares include conical flasks, test tubes, petri plates, inoculation loop, swabs, beakers. Media (nutrient agar) is prepared by rehydrating in water and dissolving it completely with the help of heat. All the glasswares and media is wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent contamination. The glasswares and media are than placed in an autoclave and sterilized for 15 minutes at 121°C and 15psi.

**2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:**

The glasswares are selected to prepare media. The selected media and glasswares are autoclaved.

**2.2 Set User Objectives &amp; Goals:**

The aim of the experiment is to create aseptic conditions for the preparation of pure cultures and reduce the chances of contamination.

**2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:**

1. The simulator gives a visual display of glasswares, almunium foil media, laminar air flow and auto clave Click on the &#39;simulation tab&#39; Perform experiment

2. To prepare media, glassware and media should be selected Click to rehydrate media To prepare media

3. Wrap glassware and media Click on the &#39;almunium foil and glassware/media to wrap To cover and protect from contamination

4. Place in autoclave Click on autoclave to open and set time temperature To sterilize

5. Remove after sterlization Click on laminar air flow to transfer the sterilized glassware and media. Unwrap and pour media To complete sterilization

**2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:**

1. What is the temperature required for sterilization?

2. How does an steam sterilization work?

3. What are the different media used in the preparation of pure cultures?

4. What is the use of laminar air flow

**2.5Allow pitfalls:**

Choosing the wrong glassware will spill the media during its preparation.

Not wrapping the glass ware and media in foil may cause breakage to glassware

Not wrapping the glass ware and media will also lead contamination

**2.6 Conclusion:**

Assessment/evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user and marks should also be assigned.
