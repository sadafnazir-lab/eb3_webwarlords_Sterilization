Culture media : Microorganisms need nutrients, a source of energy and certain environmental conditions in order to grow and reproduce. In the natural environment, microbes have adapted to the habitats most suitable for their needs. In the laboratory, however, these requirements must be met by culture media. A culture medium is basically an aqueous solution to which all the necessary nutrients have been added. Depending on the type and combination of nutrients, different categories of media can be made.

Sterilization : **Sterilization**  refers to any process that removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life (in particular referring to microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spores, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium, etc.

**Media**  containing agar should be heated to dissolve the agar before autoclaving. Bring the  **medium**  to the boil without scorching or burning. Most  **culture media**  will require final  **sterilization**  in an autoclave at 121Â°C for 20 minutes.
