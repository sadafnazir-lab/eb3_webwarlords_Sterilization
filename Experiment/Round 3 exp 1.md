# **1.Aim**

Preparation and sterilization of media and glassware for microbial count

# **2.Theory**

Culture media : Microorganisms need nutrients, a source of energy and certain environmental conditions in order to grow and reproduce. In the natural environment, microbes have adapted to the habitats most suitable for their needs. In the laboratory, however, these requirements must be met by culture media. A culture medium is basically an aqueous solution to which all the necessary nutrients have been added. Depending on the type and combination of nutrients, different categories of media can be made.

Sterilization : **Sterilization**  refers to any process that removes, kills, or deactivates all forms of life (in particular referring to microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, spores, unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as Plasmodium, etc.

**Media**  containing agar should be heated to dissolve the agar before autoclaving. Bring the  **medium**  to the boil without scorching or burning. Most  **culture media**  will require final  **sterilization**  in an autoclave at 121°C for 20 minutes.

# **3.Procedure**

1. Carefully weigh the proper amount of the dehydrated base medium or the correct proportion of constituent ingredients and dissolve in appropriate volume of distilled water and heat.

2. Add agar (1.5-2%) and boil the medium to dissolve the agar

3. This dissolved mixture and glassware are autoclaved at 121\*C for 15 minutes.

4. Once autoclaved, the flask allowed to cool but not to solidify.

5. The media is poured into each plate (filing 25ml in each plate)and plates are left in Laminar air flow to solidify agar.

6. After the plates were solidified completely , these are stored in incubator at required temperature.

3. The optimum pH for the growth of most bacteria lies between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_
a) 5-9
**b) 6.5-7.5**
