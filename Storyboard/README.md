Experiment 1: Preparation and sterilization of media and glassware for microbial counts

**1.Story Outline:**

Sterilization is a process of killing vegetative and spore of microorganisms. The aim of the process is to create aseptic conditions for carrying out various culture techniques. It involves a high temperature treatment of greater than 100 °C. Sterilization is carried out in an autoclave at 121°C, 15 psi for 20 minutes. All the glassware and media required for preparing pure microbial cultures are sterilized to avoid contamination of microbial colonies.

**2.Story:**

The glasswares required for preparing a pure culture are washed.The glasswares are dried in a hot air oven. Media (nutrient agar) is prepared by rehydrating in water and dissolving it completely with the help of heat on a hot plate. All the glasswares and media is wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent contamination. The glasswares and media are than placed in an autoclave and sterilized for 15 minutes at 121°C and 15psi. The sterilized glasswares and media are transferred to an autoclave.

**2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:**

In the experiment the user will be able to see a prototype of the sterilization process. The glasswares are washed under clean water and dried in a hot air oven. The media is rehydrated and dissolved by the action of heat on a hot plate. The media and glasswares are autoclaved. And in the next step the glasswares and media are transferred to laminar air flow.

**2.2 Set User Objectives &amp; Goals:**

The aim of the experiment is to create aseptic conditions for the preparation of pure cultures and reduce the chances of contamination. By this experiment the user will be able to visualise the fixed steps that are conducted to sterilize the glassware and media for preparing pure culture of microorganisms.

Goal: to enhance microbiological skills

**2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:**

1. The simulator gives a visual display of glasswares, hot air oven, laminar air flow, and auto clave Click on the &#39;simulation tab&#39; Perform experiment

2. The first step is washing the glass wares. Click to wash the glasswares.

3. The second step is to dry the washed glasswares in a hot air oven. Click to dry them in oven

4. To prepare media by rehydrating in water and dissolving on a hot plate. Click to rehydrate media To prepare media

5. Place in autoclave. Click on autoclave to sterilize

6. Remove after sterlization. Click on laminar air flow to transfer the sterilized glassware and media. Unwrap and pour media To complete sterilization

**2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:**

1. What is the temperature required for sterilization?

2. How does an steam sterilization work?

3. What are the different media used in the preparation of pure cultures?

4. What is the use of laminar air flow

**2.5Allow pitfalls:**

If the user does not follow proper procedure. The steps will not take place.

**2.6 Conclusion:**

Assessment/evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user and marks should also be assigned.
